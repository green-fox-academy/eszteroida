        <h2>Experiencer</h2>

        <p>I would say I love learning things but what I <em>really</em> prefer is aquiring knowledge, based on my own
        experiences mainly. <br> <br>I've always wished I could have the knowledge of all languages in the world - from
        now on including programming languages.</p>

        <p>Definitions</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Logic gate</dt>
        <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
            operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>

        <dt>ASCII</dt>
        <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so
            it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>

        <dt>RAM</dt>
        <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the
            general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same
            amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>

        <dt>Programming language</dt>
        <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
            They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement
            specific algorithms.</dd>

        <dt>DNS</dt>
        <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
            Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the
            participating entities.</dd>

        <dt>HTTP</dt>
        <dd>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
            foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer
            hypertext.</dd>
